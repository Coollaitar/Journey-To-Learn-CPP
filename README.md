| - Starting With Section 10 (Characters and Strings) |
| - Character Functions #include (cctype) library |
| - C-Style String #include(cstring) |
| - Working with C-style strings |
| - cin.getline(full_name,50) helps you to print full name including space upto 50 characters or any other limit you enter |
| - isalpha() function in C++ checks if the given character is an alphabet or not |
| - C++ strings #include(string) |  
| - object.substr(start_index,length) |  
| - object.find(search_string) , s1 += "Jomshi" - can used for concatinating |  
| - getline(cin,s1) - read entire line until '\n' (DOESNT STOP AT SPACE) |

| <p align="center"> [Day 06](https://github.com/Coollaitar/Journey-To-Learn-CPP/blob/main/Day%2006/day06.md) </p> |
| ------ |   
| - Starting With Functions Section |
| - #include (cmath) - cmath is library in which we can use maths function |
| - like - sqrt , cqrt , floor , ceil , round | 
| - Pass the ```parameters``` from function if it returns something |
| - Function Prototype |
| - Program gets divided into two parts one is ```Header Information``` and ```Actual Implementation``` |
| - Parameters and Return Statement |
| - Remember the rules of PEMDAS when defining the body of your functions (P- Parentheses, E- Exponents, M- Multiplication, D- Division, A- Addition, and S- Subtraction) |  
| - You can add ```default argument values``` to the function eg-double function(double pi = 3.14) |
| - If you are adding default arguements in a function then declare and define function before int main() |
| - It will not work if you define it after int main() |  
| - Overloading Functions - Using same ```Name``` for various forms of that function |
| - Passing Arrays to C++ Function |  
| - Pass by Reference |
| - Reference parameters (&parameter) |
| - Value doesnt changes even when parameter is passed into the function in main function |
| - Scope Rules |
| - Local Scope OR Block Scope |
| - Global Scope - Dont use Global Variables |
| - Local variables declared inside main function |
| - How do a ```function call``` work?? | 
| - Recursive Functions | 
| - Section Challenge Not Completed Yet |


| <p align="center"> [Day 07](https://github.com/Coollaitar/Journey-To-Learn-CPP/blob/main/Day%2007/day07.md) </p> |
| ------ | 
| - Starting With Section 12 (Pointers and References) |
| - What is Pointer ? - It is the variable whose value is an address |
| - Unintialized Pointer Contains Garbage data and Points Anywhere |
| - Use nullptr |
| - All pointers have same size |  
| - Dereferencing the pointer |
| - Dynamic Memory Allocation |
| - Allocating memory dynamically from the heap |  
| - Create Storage Dynamically (int_ptr = new int) and (delete int_ptr) or (double_ptr = new double)|
| - Relationship ```between ```Arrays and Pointers |
| - Array of Pointer prints First element of array |
| - Comparing two pointer will compare ```address``` not values |
| - Pointer Arithmetic |  
| - Constant In Pointer |
| - Passing Pointer To Function |
| - Returning a Pointer from a Function |  

| <p align="center"> [Day 08](https://github.com/Coollaitar/Journey-To-Learn-CPP/blob/main/Day%2008/day08.md) </p> |
| ------ | 
| - Continuing with Pointers |
| -* How to create pointer array - ```int *p = new int [5];``` |  
| - Delete the memory after using array (freeup the storage)- delete [] array_name |  
| - Dangling Pointer - Pointer that is pointing to released memory |
| - dont forget to release allocated memory |  
| - Use of references in pointer |  
| - L values and R values |
| - L values - are the values that have names and are addressable |
| - R values - values which are not L values (right side) (cannot be modified and not addressable)|
| - Completed Section Challenge of Section 12 -https://github.com/Coollaitar/Journey-To-Learn-CPP/blob/main/Day%2008/day08.md |
| - Completed Section 12 |
 
| <p align="center"> [Day 09](https://github.com/Coollaitar/Journey-To-Learn-CPP/blob/main/Day%2009/day09.md) </p> |
| ------ | 
| - Starting with Section 13 (OPP - Classes and Objects) |
| - Procedural Programming - Focus is on processes or actions that a program takes |
| - Classes are blueprints from which objects are created |
| - Delcaring a Class and creating Objects |
| - Class is terminated with ```;``` (semicolon) |
| - We are creating a ```User Defined Data Type``` |
| - Use dot operator |
| - Use arrow operator (mostly for pointers) |
| - Derefrence the pointer - ```(*ptr).=``` |
| - Adding public to class is important |
| - Public and Private |
| - Public , Private , Protected |  
| - Implementing Member Methods |  
| - Creating ```.h``` files |  
| - Constructors and Destructors |  
| - Constructor |
| - Overloading Constructor |
| - Destructor - Useful to release memory and other resources |
| - Calling a destructor (```~Player();```) |  

| <p align="center"> [Day 10](https://github.com/Coollaitar/Journey-To-Learn-CPP/blob/main/Day%2010/day10.md) </p> |
| ------ | 
| - Continuing with OPPS |
| - Default Constructor |  
| - Constructor with arguements and no arguements |
| - Overloading Constructor |  
| - Constructor Intialization List |  
| - Delegating Constructor |  
| - Constructor Parameters and Default Values |

| <p align="center"> [Day 11](https://github.com/Coollaitar/Journey-To-Learn-CPP/blob/main/Day%2011/day11.md) </p> |
| ------ | 
| - Continuing with OOPS |
| - Constructor Parameter and Default Values - No addition of ```No arguement constructor``` and ```One arguement constructor``` |
| - Directly initializing constructor under  ```public:``` |
| - Player empty; will not work (Ambigous)|
| - Copy Constructor |   

| <p align="center"> [Day 12](https://github.com/Coollaitar/Journey-To-Learn-CPP/blob/main/Day%2012/day12.md) </p> |
| ------ | 
| - Copy of constructor is used to intialize the members of newly created object by copying the members of an already existing object |
| - Copy of constructor has to be intialize in ```public:``` |  
| - Shallow Copying with the Copy constructor |
| - Shallow Copy - Work With Heap Memory Allocation but if some variables are dynamically allocated memory from heap section then the copied object will also reference the same memory location |  
| - Changes are made in  ```copy constructor``` to define Shallow and Deep Constructor |
| - For Shallow(we use copy constructor as) - ```*data = source.data``` |
| - For Deep(we use copy constructor as) - ```*data = *source.data``` |
| - Deep - Copy Heap Storage (Not copying pointer we are copying data to the pointer) |   
| - ```Shallow And Deep Copy Are One Of The Most Important Topic According To Me ```|
| - Move Constructors |
| - Can be used for efficiency |
| - Single ```&``` refers to ```L value``` and Double ```&&``` refers to ```R value``` |
| - Move Constructor moves the resources in the heap |
| - Intialization in ```public:``` of Move Constructor : ```Move(Move &&source)noexcept;``` |
| - The ```this``` Pointer | 
| - Using *const* with Classes - ```std::string get_name() const{return name}``` |  
| - Static Class Members |  
| - Struct V/s Classes (**Just Use Classes**)|  
| - Friends of a Class - A Function or a Class that has ```access``` to the private class members (Will be used in next section in Operator Overloading) |  
| - Section Challenge 13 remaining |
  
| <p align="center"> [Day 13](https://github.com/Coollaitar/Journey-To-Learn-CPP/blob/main/Day%2013/day13.md) </p> |
| ------ |   
| - Will Do Section Challenge in some time |  
| - Starting With Section Operator Overloading |
| - What is Operator Overloading ? - ```Using Traditional Operators``` |
| - Makes Code Easily Readable and Understandable |
| - Assignment operator must be declared as the member methods |
