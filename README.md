| - Learnt how to add user input while printing the output in between of text. |
| - Learnt how to get input from user by just separating it by spaces.|
| - Completed 5 sections of the course and practiced some basic codes. |
| - Learnt how to get user input and how to print the output using cin and cout. |

| - push_back is used to add elements in vectors at the end |
| - .size() is used to print size of vector |
| - .at() is used to print or take input at particular index of vector |
| - #include vector is used while coding with vectors | 
| - vector <dtype> variable_name {} or () : used for declaring vector |
| - Will be starting with section 8 ( Statements and Operators ) tommorow |
